🖥️ How It Works

The HTML (index.html) contains headings, paragraphs, and a list inside a section.

The CSS (style.css) applies styling using:

h1 styled with element selector

#header-1 styled with ID selector

.sub-body and .sub-body-1 styled with class selectors

* styled with universal selector to apply base layout

Open index.html in any web browser.
